Perturbation of Specfem Source
------------------------------

Thye next step in the workflow is to create the sources for the inversion
workflow. Meaning, for each parameter to invert for we need to perturb the
source and simulate an earthquake using a perturbed source to compute the
Fr√©chet derivative afterwards. The creation of the specfem_sources is done
using the ``GCMT3D``'s ``SpecfemSources`` class. The class will create both
the ``CMTSOLUTION`` needed for the specfem simulations as well as the
``QuakeML`` needed for the inversion/ASDF file creation later on.

The perturbation parameters can be found in the ``InversionParams.yml``
parameter file.
