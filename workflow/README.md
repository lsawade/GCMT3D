# Will be a apart of the GCMT3D package in the future
# Just making sure that this is created with a good overview.
In the end it will be set in the GCMT3D package as scripts and include the implementation of EnTK for an easy workflow.

# Workflow for CMT inversion 

This is a repository for the workflow of the CMT inversion using the GCMT3D package.
This package contains parameters Jupyter notebooks and everything necessary to run
inversion and spawn jobs (only on tiger for now).

## Requirements

The only requirement is having GCMT3D installed. GCMT3D (and its dependencies) will 
solve all, data management, simulation and inversion. GCMT3D is located at
[GCMT package repo](https://github.com/lsawade/GCMT3D).
